# Microondas em JAVA

My main idea is to create something based on my recent studies on JAVA. As a begginer, this is just an experiment with the knowledge of methods and some ideas that came with it.

Why? Because when you don't use it, you lose it (my line. If someone says that, it's a steal and I will probably sue this person).
